# Secure Healthcare Information Network System

A secure, scalable, and simulation-based healthcare network infrastructure designed to protect sensitive medical data, improve communication efficiency, and ensure regulatory compliance using modern networking and security practices.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Healthcare systems manage highly sensitive data such as patient records, research data, and operational workflows. This project implements a **Secure Healthcare Information Network System** that addresses key challenges including data breaches, insecure communication, poor scalability, and lack of proper network segmentation.

The system is designed and simulated using **Cisco Packet Tracer**, following a modular and hierarchical network architecture suitable for real-world healthcare environments.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Network segmentation using VLANs  
- Secure remote access using VPN  
- Data protection via Cisco ASA Firewall and ACLs  
- VoIP integration for efficient internal communication  
- Secure LAN and WLAN connectivity  
- Centralized DHCP and DNS services  
- Scalable architecture for future expansion  

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The network follows a hierarchical design consisting of:

- **Core Layer** – Routing and security enforcement  
- **Distribution Layer** – VLAN management and traffic control  
- **Access Layer** – Wired and wireless end devices  

### Key Architectural Features

- VLAN-based departmental isolation  
- Firewall-protected DMZ  
- Redundant links for fault tolerance  
- Secure VPN gateway for remote access
