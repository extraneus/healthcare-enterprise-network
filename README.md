# Secure Healthcare Information Network System

A secure, scalable, and simulation-based healthcare network infrastructure designed to protect sensitive medical data, improve communication efficiency, and ensure regulatory compliance using modern networking and security practices.Healthcare systems manage highly sensitive data such as patient records, research data, and operational workflows. This project implements a **Secure Healthcare Information Network System** that addresses key challenges including data breaches, insecure communication, poor scalability, and lack of proper network segmentation.

The system is designed and simulated using **Cisco Packet Tracer**, following a modular and hierarchical network architecture suitable for real-world healthcare environments.

## Objectives

- Network segmentation using VLANs  
- Secure remote access using VPN  
- Data protection via Cisco ASA Firewall and ACLs  
- VoIP integration for efficient internal communication  
- Secure LAN and WLAN connectivity  
- Centralized DHCP and DNS services  
- Scalable architecture for future expansion  

---

## System Architecture

The network follows a hierarchical design consisting of:

- **Core Layer** – Routing and security enforcement  
- **Distribution Layer** – VLAN management and traffic control  
- **Access Layer** – Wired and wireless end devices  

### Key Architectural Features

- VLAN-based departmental isolation  
- Firewall-protected DMZ  
- Redundant links for fault tolerance  
- Secure VPN gateway for remote access

## Security Features

- Cisco ASA Firewall  
- Access Control Lists (ACLs)  
- Encrypted VPN access  
- Intrusion Detection System (IDS)  
- WPA3-secured wireless network  
- HTTPS-enabled web services  
- SSL/TLS-secured email communication
